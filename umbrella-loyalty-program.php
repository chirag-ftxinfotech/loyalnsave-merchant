This eliminates competition and creates a win-win situation for the retailer. Loyal~n~Save has a simple, three-step process to get your loyalty program up-and-running.</p>

                                        Why is an umbrella loyalty program better than a coalition loyalty program?

                                        Umbrella loyalty programs are better than the traditional coalition loyalty programs because they include stores or brands of the same retailer. This eliminates unhealthy competition. The retailer gets engagement benefits, regardless of the store in which a consumer redeems their reward.

                                    <button class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">
                                    Can I include external brands in the umbrella?
                                    </button>
                                </div>

                                    Yes, you can. If you want to partner with another brand and offer a coalition loyalty program, the umbrella loyalty program feature lets you do that. You can add multiple brands under your umbrella to provide various options to your consumers.

                                    What is the benefit of having an umbrella of stores in a loyalty program?
                                    </button>
                                </div>

                                    <div class="card-body">
                                        Having an umbrella of multiple stores and brands enables you to give more options to your consumers. If you allow your consumers to redeem their rewards from one store only, they may lose interest. Offering them multiple options will keep them engaged.

                                    What if I have one store only?
                                    </button>
                                </div>
                                <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour" data-parent="#accordion">
                                    <div class="card-body">
                                        That’s perfectly fine. Most retailers run successful loyalty programs with one store, and so can you. Loyal~n~Save is a flexible loyalty program management solution that helps you run and manage your loyalty programs, regardless of the size of your business.
