                        <p>Loyal~n~Save is a loyalty platform offered by FasTrax Solutions, a company that specializes in retail POS, warehouse management systems, and digital marketing solutions. The platform is designed to help retailers boost customer engagement by enabling them to reward customers for cash and credit card purchases. In addition, the platform grants points to customers who refer friends and family members. Each customer who creates a team of fellow shoppers is eligible to earn special team reward points based on team members’ purchases.</p>
                        <p>Loyalty360's Mark Johnson sat down with Kasey Cover, Digital Marketing & Consumer Loyalty at FasTrax Solutions, to discuss the various kinds of loyalty programs and their benefits. Here's what they had to say: </p>
                        <p class="blog-image"><img src="http://placehold.it/1400x700" alt="" /></p>

                        <h5>Describe an umbrella program and how it’s different from a traditional program and from a coalition program.</h5>
                        <p>A coalition loyalty program many people were once familiar with was Plenti Rewards. Their idea of having one system for multiple merchants sounded wonderful. However, looks were deceiving. Their multi-merchant design allowed customers to redeem rewards at stores in which they did not make the purchase at, making it highly unfair for opposing merchants. This created an accounting nightmare regarding company liability and accountability. Almost like a game of Russian roulette. When was the merchant going to pay, and how much?</p>
                        <p>Loyal~n~Save is not like Plenti. We brand ourselves as an umbrella program instead of a coalition because while we have multiple merchants housed under our program. All points and rewards are kept completely separate. Umbrella programs have a similar feel as coalition programs (i.e., with all stores listed as participants), except each store has their own point bucket and options to create their own campaigns and offers. The campaigns available to merchants go way beyond points or virtual punch cards, and offer rich and dynamic options that can be customized in pretty much any way you choose. We also give merchants an online Swag Shop where they can customize their rewards for point redemption. This differs from coalition loyalty programs because in this case, your program is literally what you make it.</p>
