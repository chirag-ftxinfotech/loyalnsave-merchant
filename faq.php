Think of us as a virtual shopping mall, we house multiple stores under one roof. We like to call ourselves an “umbrella program” rather than a coalition program because all stores and their points are separate. By using our platform you have complete control over your loyalty program, including campaigns, point redemption, and more.</div>

On the web and with the mobile app, customers won't miss out on any of the action, like campaigns, rewards, coupons, and swag items. Customers also have the ability to earn more points than they would with a traditional loyalty program, just by referring their friends and families directly to your store. Each purchase a friend makes, they'll earn points for it too. Gamification techniques keep them engaged and returning back to your store time and again.</div>
