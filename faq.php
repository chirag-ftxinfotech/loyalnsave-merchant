                                    <p>Loyal~n~Save is a premium loyalty rewards program with unique Team Rewards that encourage customers to invite their friends through word-of-mouth referrals. Think of us as a virtual shopping mall, we house multiple stores under one roof. We like to call ourselves an “umbrella program” rather than a coalition program because all stores and their points are separate. By using our platform you have complete control over your loyalty program, including campaigns, point redemption, and more.</p>

With Team Rewards, you’ll have the option to give a small percentage back to the customer by incentivizing cash purchases. Share the savings from credit card processing fees to offer more to your customers to keep them coming back while putting more profits to your bottom line.</p>

Customers also have the ability to earn more points than they would with a traditional loyalty program, just by referring their friends and families directly to your store. Each purchase a friend makes, they’ll earn points for it too. Gamification techniques keep them engaged and returning back to your store time and again.</p>
