                        <h3>What can a loyalty program do for you?</h3>
                        <p>Every salon has their peak times and slow times. It's often necessary to turn away appointments or book them for weeks aftertheir supposed return date during those heavily requested times. Loyal~n~Save can help you eliminate this concern by motivating flexible clients to visit during the slowertimes. Create special campaigns that offer"HappyHour" bonus points.Offering extra loyalty points can give the customerthat extra push to book an appointment at a time they normally wouldn't,thus opening up the busier times for clients who may not be so flexible during the day.</p>
                        <p>Word-of-mouth and customerreviews are the cheapest, yet most effective, methods of pulling in new clients.Offering a pointincentive forreferring friends and family orfor posting a review on online and social platforms will encourage more positive buzz around your salon.</p>
