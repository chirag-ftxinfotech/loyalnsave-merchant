                    <p class="header__desc">As a pet retailer, you already know that you have some of the most loyal customers ever. Your customers want what is best for their animal(s) because they are a part of their family. They will stay loyal to a brand because they know their pet likes it, but who's to say they won't start getting that brand at a store down the road because it's cheaper or they offer special discounts. Loyal~n~Save can help turn those brand loyal customers into loyal customers of your location.</p>

                        <p>Your customers love their pets like they're a family member. They would do anything for them, including spending a fortune on pet products. Once they find a brand their pet loves, there's no turning them back, they are BRAND loyal. There's only one problem: Other retailers sell that same brand, maybe even for cheaper. Once the customer realizes this they are going to start purchasing that brand elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Utilizing a loyalty program will keep your brand-loyal customers loyal to your establishment as well. With Loyal~n~Save there's no more waiting for manufacturers to offer a coupon. You are in charge of your store's specific coupons and promotions. With our team earnings and gamified earnings platform, you can sit back and watch your customer base grow as loyal customers convert friends and family into loyal customers.</p>
