                                <p>Loyal~n~Save offers the Umbrella Loyalty Program, an upgraded version of traditional coalition loyalty programs. It lets you create an umbrella of all your stores and allows your customers to redeem their rewards in any store of their choice. This program gives more options to your customers while ensuring that they remain inside your brand's ecosystem.</p>
                                <p>The umbrella loyalty program is different from the coalition loyalty program. In a coalition loyalty program, several brands are a part of a loyalty program, and a customer can redeem their rewards at any brand's store. The problem with this method was that customers could redeem their rewards at a brand's store even if they had not purchased from there. This led to unhappiness and unhealthy competition between brands. An umbrella loyalty program resolves this hurdle.</p>

                                <p>The team builder module in Loyal~n~Save lets your cashiers, customers and their team earn bonus points through team building by referring your store through referral codes. Customers can add members to their team, and every time anyone from their team member makes a purchase, the customer earns a percentage of their points. You can add as many members as you want to your team; though you'll get team-building rewards for up to five tiers, there is no limit to how many members you can add to each tier.</p>
                                <p>Team Builder also helps businesses to retain their cashiers for a long time since they get to earn more bonus points through which they can earn rewards and purchase products from swag shop or get them re-imbursed for cash (depends on how you set the rules). Team members can share their referral links and get a commission if someone purchases a product using that link.</p>
