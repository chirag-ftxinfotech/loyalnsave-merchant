                    <p>Loyal~n~Save provides a platform for merchants to develop, operate and maintain consumer loyalty programs through the Loyal~n~Save consumer website and merchant website (each a “Website”), the Loyal~n~Save mobile application (“Smartphone App”or “App”), and the Loyal~n~Save loyalty plastic cards (“Plastic Cards”) (the Websites, Smartphone App, and Plastic Cards being collectively referred to as the “Loyal~n~Save Properties”).</p>
                    <p>The merchant entity that has signed the Merchant Agreement ("Merchant," "you," or “your”) will develop a tailored promotional loyalty program ("Merchant Loyalty Program”), which will consist of a reward-based loyalty program tracked using the Loyal~n~Save Properties, which results in customers (“Users”): (1) earning credits, rewards, discounts, coupons, loyalty tier awards, and other rewards with each eligible purchase from your business (“Rewards”), (2) being exposed to personalized offers, promotions, events, incentives and discounts ("Offers"), (3) receiving digital copies of their Merchant receipts using the Smartphone App and consumer Website (“Digital Receipts”), (4) receiving communications from you in the form of email, text messages, push notifications, or other communications (“Marketing”) and (5) providing customer feedback using the Loyal~n~Save marketing platform. Merchant shall be responsible for each Offer and Reward in its Merchant Loyalty Program, including the creation of the Offer/Reward and for legal compliance of each Offer/Reward in each jurisdiction where offered and redeemable.</p>
                    <p>Merchant will create Offers and Rewards using the Loyal~n~Save Offer creation program (“Offer Creation Program”) which is available on the Merchant Website. The merchant shall retain sole responsibility for each Offer’s legal compliance in the jurisdictions where offered and redeemable. As part of the Merchant Loyalty Program, Loyal~n~Save will also provide to Merchant, at Merchant’s request, periodic detailed data reports covering select aspects of Merchant’s business, including the Merchant Loyalty Program. (Loyal~n~Save data review and reporting, loyalty offer generation services, Marketing and all other services provided by Loyal~n~Save for the direct or indirect benefit of Merchant may be referred to herein as the “Loyal~n~Save Service”).</p>

                        <li>comply with all Applicable Laws regarding the Merchant Loyalty Program. Without limiting the foregoing, Merchant acknowledges that Applicable Law may require Merchant to redeem Rewards beyond any date specified in the Merchant Loyalty Program terms.

                        <li>not directly or indirectly offer or otherwise market, or permit any third party to offer or otherwise market a promotion, sale, discount, offer, or reward (including loyalty reward) that contains terms which are better than those of any Offer and/or Reward within any loyalty tier within your Merchant Loyalty Program, including through any third-party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless a similar or better Offer or Reward is also made available through the Merchant Loyalty Program;</li>
                        <li>not directly or indirectly use the Loyal~n~Save Services for sending unsolicited messages (“spam”) or for hosting of illegal or prohibited content;</li>
                        <li>if the Consumer Product Safety Commission or other federal, state, or local agency issues an order pursuant to any consumer protection law requiring Merchant to recall, replace, repair, or make refunds with respect to all or part of any products and/or services offered or provided in connection with the Merchant Loyalty Program or where Merchant determines that a recall is warranted, Merchant shall do so at its expense and assume all costs (including without limitation, reimbursements to Loyal~n~Save for its out-of-pocket expenses) and such recall shall be effectuated in a manner determined by Merchant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Loyal~n~Save shall not be liable for any cost, loss, or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
                    <h4>4. Merchant Loyalty Programs</h4>
                    <p>When Loyal~n~Save advertises Offers or Rewards associated with your Merchant Loyalty Program, we do so as an independent marketing portal and platform. You, as the merchant, are the sole provider of the Offers and the sole issuer of the Rewards, and you are the exclusive seller of the products and/or services described in the Merchant Loyalty Program.</p>
                    <p>Merchant shall at all times, retain the legal obligation to honor the Offers and redeem the Rewards for the products and/or services promised to the Users under the Merchant Loyalty Program, in compliance with these Standard Terms and all Applicable Law. Use of any Offers and/or Rewards for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of Merchant, and shall comply with all Applicable Law. You agree that in providing the products and/or services through the Merchant Loyalty program you will not impose any restrictions on redemption unless such restriction is otherwise expressly communicated to User and is in compliance with Applicable Law, extra fees, charges and/or conditions that contradict the Merchant Agreement or the specific terms set forth in connection with the Merchant Loyalty Program or any Applicable Law.</p>
                    <p>Merchant understands and agrees that Loyal~n~Save has the right to promote the Merchant Loyalty Program, and you agree to honor all Offers and Rewards associated therewith. Each Offer associated with the Merchant Loyalty Program will expire on the date on which the Offer is set to expire as set forth thereon or herein (the "Offer Expiration Date"). Should you decide to stop or cancel an Offer, you acknowledge that you retain the legal obligation to honor the Offer for those Users who 'saved’ the Offer prior to the date you cancel or stop the Offer.</p>
                    <p>Except as specified by Merchant or as provided herein, each Reward earned by a User is set to expire twelve (12) months after that User’s last purchase date with the Merchant Loyalty Program (the “Rewards Expiration Date”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Rewards Expiration Date, you shall, for the period of time required by Applicable Law, continue to allow all unredeemed Rewards to be redeemed to purchase products and/or services specified in the Merchant Loyalty Program. You will be solely responsible for ensuring that the Rewards Expiration Date and terms of the Merchant Loyalty Program comply with all Applicable Law.</p>
                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that in certain jurisdictions Applicable Law regulates the permitted expiration of all or certain Rewards, and may require you to redeem such Rewards beyond their stated Rewards Expiration Date and/or to provide the User with a refund equal to the cash value (the purchase value) of the Reward if the User requests a refund after the Rewards Expiration Date, and you agree to do so to the extent so required by law. Loyal~n~Save shall have no obligation to make any redemption to User in place of Merchant.</p>
                    <h4>5. Control of Websites and Smartphone App</h4>
                    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, Loyal~n~Save shall have the right to determine the content, appearance, functionality, and all other aspects of the Websites and Smartphone App in its discretion. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding any other provision of these Standard Terms, Loyal~n~Save shall have the right to redesign, modify, and alter the organization, structure, “look and feel,” navigation, appearance, functionality, and other elements of all or a part of the Websites and Smartphone App, and any aspect, portion or feature thereof, including with regards to the Merchant Loyalty Program.</p>
                    <h4>6. User Complaints and Returns</h4>
                    <p>Any User complaints that principally concern the Loyal~n~Save Properties shall be promptly forwarded to Loyal~n~Save; all other User complaints shall be promptly forwarded to, and be the sole responsibility of the Merchant. It is the Merchant’s sole responsibility to answer/and or resolve all complaints, disputes, or questions regarding the operation of the Merchant’s loyalty program.</p>
                    <p>If a User wishes to return an item purchased as a result of an Offer or redeemed Rewards, it shall be in the Merchant’s sole discretion whether to accept such returns pursuant to the Merchant Loyalty Program, but in any event, shall be in accordance with all Applicable Law.</p>
                    <h4>7. Fraudulent Use</h4>
                    <p>Loyal~n~Save will take reasonable efforts to avoid fraudulent use of the Loyal~n~Save Properties by Users, including, when necessary, by sending prompt emails to Users to confirm accurate use of the Merchant Loyalty Program.</p>
                    <p>In addition, Loyal~n~Save will take reasonable efforts to avoid fraudulent use of the Loyal~n~Save Properties by Merchant’s employees, including by sending prompt emails to Merchant to notify of possible fraudulent behavior of one of its employees in regards to the Merchant Loyalty Program. If a User suffers Rewards loss associated with a Merchant employee’s fraudulent use of applicable Loyal~n~Save Properties, the merchant Website or interface and/or any offer platform, the Merchant is solely responsible for reimbursing the User with the equivalent points and/or rewards that were lost.</p>
                    <h4>8. Payments</h4>
                    <p>Merchant will Pay Loyal~n~Save a monthly base fee in accordance with the Merchant Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that amounts retained by Loyal~n~Save are for its marketing, advertising, and administration of the Merchant Loyalty program.</p>
                    <p>All fees are payable by the Merchant to Loyal~n~Save in accordance with the Merchant Agreement. You shall be billed by Loyal~n~Save in accordance with your Merchant Agreement.</p>
                    <p>Loyal~n~Save may change the fees it charges for any Services by providing the Merchant notice of such change at least 30 days before the change becomes effective. If the Merchant does not agree to any such change in fees, Merchant may terminate this contract (and Merchant’s use of the Services) by notifying Loyal~n~Save of termination prior to the effective date of the fee change. This contract and Merchant’s use of the Services shall thereupon be terminated as of the effective date of the fee change. Merchant’s failure to terminate this contract prior to the effective date of the fee change shall constitute Merchant’s acceptance of the change in fees.</p>

                    <p>In the event of cancellation by Merchant, we will cease promotion of the Merchant Loyalty Program and Offers on or about the Notice Date. In the event of cancellation by Loyal~n~Save, we will cease promotion of the Merchant Loyalty Program and/or Offer(s) promptly. You must honor all legal Offers 'saved’ and all Rewards earned prior to the Cancellation Date. A list of all Offers 'saved’ and Rewards earned and unredeemed as of the Cancellation Date, will be provided to you by Loyal~n~Save and may also be made available to you on the merchant Website. In all cases, it is Merchant’s sole responsibility to settle all outstanding Rewards in accordance with the terms of the Merchant Loyalty Program and Applicable Law. The cancellation of the Merchant Loyalty Program, or any Offer or Reward, shall be without liability to Loyal~n~Save.</p>
                    <h4>17. Data Reports</h4>
                    <p>We seek to protect Merchant information (such as Transaction Data and Reports) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Merchant information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of Merchant information at any time. We otherwise store all of our information using industry-standard techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to Merchant’s information that we store, Transaction Data, Reports, or otherwise. Upon Merchant cancellation, and subject to Merchant’s written notice, Loyal~n~Save will make reasonable efforts to erase or transfer to Merchant, the Transaction Data and Reports in part or in full to the extent possible under the measures mentioned above. Digital Receipts and credits waiting to be redeemed will not be deleted from the User account and will remain visible to the Users.</p>
                    <h4>18. Arbitration</h4>
                    <p>The Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) represents the entire agreement of the parties as to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior written and oral representations and discussions between the parties. If a matter arises that cannot be resolved between you and Loyal~n~Save with reasonable effort, you agree that all such disagreements or disputes that in any way involves the Merchant Loyalty Program or the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding administration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and will be conducted before a single arbiter pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA. You agree that the arbitration shall be held in a place chosen by the arbitration firm in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to Merchant headquarters, or at any other location that is mutually agreed upon by you and Loyal~n~Save in writing. You agree that the arbiter will apply the laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, and will honor and agree to all applicable statutes of limitation. You agree that, unless prohibited by law, there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, and arbitration will only decide a dispute between you and Loyal~n~Save. If any part of this Arbitration clause is later deemed invalid as a matter of law, then the remaining portions of this section shall remain in effect, with the exception of the class language referenced herein, in such case this entire section shall be deemed invalid.</p>
                    <p>The parties are independent contractors. Except for our right to advertise on your behalf in accordance with the Merchant Loyalty Program, this Agreement does not create any joint venture or agency, and you and we are independent contractors without the power to bind the other.</p>
                    <p>The communications between Merchant and Loyal~n~Save may use electronic means. For contractual purposes, Merchant (a) consents to receive communications from Loyal~n~Save in an electronic form, and (b) agrees that all Terms and Conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Loyal~n~Save provides to you electronically will satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were in writing. The foregoing does not affect Merchant’s statutory rights.</p>
                    <p>If any provision of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions contained in this Agreement, and the remaining portions of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
                    <h4>19. Choice of Law</h4>
                    <p>Any disputes arising out of or related to the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and/or the Merchant Loyalty Program shall be governed in all respects, whether as to validity, construction, capacity, performance, or otherwise, by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its choice of law rules and without regard to conflicts of laws principles except that the Arbitration provision in Section 18 shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
                    <h4>20. General</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Independent Contractors. </strong><br />Each party shall be deemed to be an independent contractor hereunder. The Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) creates no relationship of joint venture, partnership, or agency between the parties, and the parties hereby acknowledge that no other facts or relations exist that would create any such relationship between them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assignment </strong><br />Neither party may transfer, assign, or sell the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) or any part thereof, without the prior written permission of the other party, provided that either party may assign the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and its rights and obligations hereunder in connection with a corporate reorganization, merger, or sale, or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets. The Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each party and its permitted successors and assigns.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prevailing Party. </strong><br />If any legal action or other proceeding is brought for a breach of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) or any of the warranties herein, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in bringing such action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which such party may be entitled.</li>
                        <li><strong>Complete Agreement. </strong><br />The Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms), and other documents or materials referenced herein is the exclusive statement of the agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter as of this date and supersedes all prior written or oral agreements. Deviations from and amendment to the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) are not valid unless made in writing by an authorized officer each of Loyal~n~Save and the Merchant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Survival. </strong><br />Sections 4-20 hereof, and all accrued rights and remedies hereunder, shall survive any termination of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms).</li>
                        <li><strong>No Implied Waivers. </strong><br />The failure of either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms), or the failure to require at any time performance by the other party of any of the provisions of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms), shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provisions, nor in any way affect the ability of either party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express written waiver by either party of any provision, condition or requirement of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition, or requirement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Force Majeure. </strong><br />Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance under the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms), or for any interruption of services rendered hereunder, which result directly or indirectly from acts of God, civil or military authority, act of public enemies, war, accidents, fires, explosions, earthquakes, floods, the elements or any other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party, provided that, in order to be excused from delay or failure to perform, the non-performing party must act diligently to remedy such delay or failure. In the event such a delay continues for five (5) or more consecutive days, the other party shall have the right to terminate the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) upon notice to the non-performing party.</li>
                        <li><strong>Severability. </strong><br />If any provision of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) should, for any reason, be held invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the remainder of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) shall be enforced to the full extent permitted by law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Headings; Construction. </strong><br />The headings of various paragraphs of the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) are inserted merely for the purposes of convenience and do not expressly or by implication limit, define, or extend the specific terms or text of the paragraph so designated. In resolving any dispute or construing any provision hereunder there shall be no presumptions made or inferences drawn because one of the parties drafted the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) and each party waives any rights under any law that would require the interpretation of any ambiguities in the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) against the party that drafted it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Notices. </strong><br />All notices required or desired to be given hereunder shall be in writing and if not personally delivered, be sent by facsimile (with copy by ordinary mail) or by overnight courier or registered or certified mail to the party’s address set forth on the Merchant Agreement, or of which a party notifies the other party in writing in accordance with this Section. If sent via facsimile or personally delivered, notices shall be deemed to have been given on the day when personally delivered or sent. If mailed by overnight courier or registered or certified mail, notices shall be deemed to have been given when received.</li>
                        <li><strong>Modification of Standard Terms. </strong><br />We may modify the Merchant Agreement (including these Standard Terms) from time to time, and such modification shall be effective upon five (5) days after we have sent an e-mail to you containing a notification of such modifications.
